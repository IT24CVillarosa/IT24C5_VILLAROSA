                    Through building my own site using HTML and CSS, I have been more able to comprehend event-driven programming. This was largely oriented towards front-end development, but it covered basic ideas related to event-driven programming. The author highlighted the importance of having well-organized webpage that has easy navigation and attractive visuals as they all help improve user experience which is a vital feature in web design. Pages such as “Services”, “About Me”, “Resume” and “Testimonial” were developed in order to arrange content properly thus keeping the website user friendly and simple to navigate through.

                    <br>   </br>In background images through HTML a valuable lesson was learnt. The way to insert visuals in web pages clearly demonstrated how imperative design elements can enhance user experience. It was observed that the selected background image can significantly shape the site’s visitors’ reactions, which are either welcoming or distracting depending on whether it is well done or not. This made it clear that one must be cautious when selecting pictures and this should be done in tandem with the design itself.
                    
                    <br>   </br>Among other things, this paper examined how to use CSS to alter the colour of fonts, navigational tabs as well as footers. In this way, it allowed for imaginative latitude while underscoring the need for consistency and contrast in readability and design appeal. However, in order to align it with an intended style, the look of the website was adjusted yet remained formal. Alterations were also made in these aspects to improve the website’s design so that it could suit individual tastes or serve certain purposes.
